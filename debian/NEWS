bmake (20200710-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  To use bmake with NetBSD mk files, it is now possible to use the pmake
  wrapper, which defaults to /usr/share/bmake/mk-netbsd instead of
  bmake mk files. The debhelper plugin will automatically detect the use
  of <bsd.*.mk> and switch to pmake.

bmake (20200710-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  From this version on, NetBSD mk files are no longer used by default.
  These files are still shipped in /usr/share/bmake/mk-netbsd, but
  the bmake mk files are used by default.
